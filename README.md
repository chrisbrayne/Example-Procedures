# Example-Procedures

This sis a repo to hold procedure documentation.

I hope to build a series of documentsb and structures to detail a simple procedure and allow the trackingh of edits and continuous imoprovement by a number of collaborators.

I am using the prose.io editing tool to simplfy the user ineterface.

It has basis formating capabilities.

Such as 

## headings
[Hyperlinks](http://link.com/link.html "a link")
Images  
**Bold**  
_Italics_  
> Quotes> We loved with a love that was more than love

Bullet lists 
- .22
- .44
- 303

and

Numbered lists like this one
1. apples
2. pears
3. oranges
